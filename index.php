				<font class="title"> Design of a Radar System for Sense and Avoid Applications </font>
				
				<p> A newly developed compact radar from Texas Instruments is fused with a monocular camera, targeting a future integration in fixed wing planes, that are autonomously sensing and avoiding intruding UAVs and other objects such as power lines. </p>

				<font class="title"> Suitability of NBLD Descriptors for Matching Vision to Lidar Maps </font>
				
				<p> Datasets containing lidar and vision maps (reconstructed from images of the same scene) are recorded for three scenes. The NBLD descriptor, a specific type of point cloud descriptor designed to operate on sparse vision maps, is evaluated on these three datasets and turns out show good potential in finding correspondences between the two types of maps, especially when using a dense vision map. </p>

				<font class="title"> Omnidirectional Short Range Hazard Mapping For Legged Robots </font>
				
				<p> Development and testing of a self contained prototype for generating short range, omnidirectional hazard maps for legged robots. The developed system uses an ordinary perspective camera in combination with the Kogeto Dot mirror and is modelled as a paracatadiopric system. The implemented algorithms are based on existing equations for estimating the time to contact (TTC) of an approaching tilted plane.

				<p> Literature review on range sensing principles followed by a comparison of commercial 3D range finders. Camera and laser based 3D depth sensing principles are summarised and compared.  An objective comparison of current commercial products, primarily based on information from datasheets, leads to a selection of useful models to consider for local mapping and SLAM tasks for mobile robots. </p>

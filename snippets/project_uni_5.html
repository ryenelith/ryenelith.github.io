				<h3>summary</h3>
				The goal of the innovation project was to design a system that is moved using a cable (like a cable car) and can pick up different objects. The objects are lying spread on the ground and are to be transported to the top station. The developed system is a team effort of 6 students. I was involved in:
				<ul>
				<li> creating ideas, being creative </li>
				<li> building prototypes </li>
				<li> CAD drawing </li>
				<li> assembly </li>
				<li> webdesign </li>
				 </ul>
